# Metro Vancouver Transit Analytics (2016-2024)

### Project Overview
An interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing passenger flow and station efficiency across the TransLink network (SkyTrain & Canada Line). 
I wanted to create a visual of the volume and efficiency to cover the growth of cities and stations as ridership data recovered from the pandemic. 

**Objective:** To move beyond simple "total ridership" metrics and identify high-density transit hubs by normalizing boardings against station count.

### 🛠 Tools Used
* **Power BI:** Advanced DAX measures, Treemaps, Conditional Formatting (Gradient Logic).
* **Python (Pandas):** Data cleaning and preparation.
* **Data Source:** TransLink Open Data (2016-2024).
